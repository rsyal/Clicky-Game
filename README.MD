Clicky-Game

This application is a memory-type game using React.

This game displays an array of pictures for the user to click on. Once an image is clicked, the photos are rearranged. If you click on the same image twice, then you lose!

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

The images shuffle after the user clicks the same image.Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts and the score goes to 0.
